Machine Learning Course Project Report

I accidentally submitted the URL of the GitHub repo instead of the gh-pages one.   
Please accept my apologies.

Please see the more convenient gh-pages version at http://pedrosan.github.io/ML/   
It is also posted at http://rpubs.com/PedroSan/ML-WL

Also, I got a bit confused with the 'master' vs. 'gh-pages' branches, and had
to spend a few minutes re-syncing the 'master' branch of the repository.
